    <h1>About Us</h1>   

    <p>Company’s mission statement: The founder and CEO of Trusted Travel started Trusted Travel Advisor in early 2021 to share her love of travel and exploration with users for free. But it is her belief that in addition to gaining traveling tips, users of Trusted Travel learn about the country beforehand making them educated tourists; equipped to make the most of their trip, and unlikely to insult the traditions or customs of the native people of the country they’re visiting. Learning about a country before visiting only enhances the travel experience. <br>
    What sets us apart from other travel agencies is that all of our recommendations are based on first-hand experience. Our experts can tell clients whether certain excursions are worth the price or just tourist traps. <br>
    Currently, our company offers advice on four different countries: Argentina, Japan, Egypt, and Tanzania. Collectively, the team has explored over 65 countries, and is looking forward to adding the same caliber of information about additional countries within the year &ndash; just in time, as more countries reopen for tourism again following the COVID-19 suspension. <br>
    On behalf of the Trusted Travel family, we would like to thank you for taking a look at us.</p>
