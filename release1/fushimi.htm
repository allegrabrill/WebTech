    <h1>Fushimi Inari Taisha Shrine</h1>
    <p>&emsp;&ensp;Regardless of your religion, visiting a Buddhist temple or Shinto shrine is a must in Japan. Shrines are peaceful and fascinating, with many rituals to observe. They are often in lovely natural forest or mountainside settings.</p>
	<p>&emsp;&ensp;In Kyoto, visit Fushimi Inari, where you’ll see scores of bright orange torii gates winding up a forest on a mountainside during a 90 minute walk. Since it gets incredibly crowded, it’s best to arrive before 7am or after 8pm when it’s less congested.</p>
	<p>&emsp;&ensp;Kinkaku-ji (the Golden Temple) is another temple in Kyoto. Although this temple is also very crowded, the gold pavilion reflected in the shimmering pond within the leafy gardens is worth the trip.</p>
