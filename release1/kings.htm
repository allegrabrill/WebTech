    <h2>Travel Tip</h2>
	<p>&emsp;&ensp;Rules regarding photography are constantly changing. The most recent rules state that if you want to take pictures with equipment other than your smartphone, you must purchase a photopass. In Egypt, most things must be paid for in cash as credit cards are not widely accepted. Additionally, there are no ATMs at the east bank of the Valley of the Kings or the Visitor Center, so you should bring cash with you for Luxor.</p>
