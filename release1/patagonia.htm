    <h1>Patagonia</h1>
    <p> <img  style="width: 300px;" src="patagonia.jpg" alt="patagonia">
    &emsp;&ensp;Patagonia is renowned for its spectacular landscapes, which juxtapose the mountains of the Andes with long expanses of plateaus and plains. Patagonia comprises three regions: the Lake District, Atlantic Patagonia, and Southern Patagonia. Southern Patagonia is characterized by deserts expanding into cattle-ranges and glaciers.<br>
    &emsp;&ensp;The best time to visit Patagonia is during springtime (October through November) and summertime in the southern hemisphere (December through February). This is when the weather is mild and visitors can best appreciate the full splendor of the natural attractions.<br>
    &emsp;&ensp;For wildlife lovers, Argentina has a wealth of species. Patagonia is home to penguins, seals, and sea lions, as well as herons, pumas, condors, guanacos and tortoises &ndash; and very few humans.<br>
    &emsp;&ensp;One popular Patagonia tourist attraction that lives up to its reputation is Los Glaciares National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. From the small town of El Calafate, tourists can take excursions to the impressive Perito Moreno Glacier, and even can climb the glacier on ice trekking tours.</p>

    
    
    <h2>Ushuaia</h2>
    <p>&emsp;&ensp;Ushuaia, the capital city of the Tierra del Fuego province, is in the most southern part of Argentina. Often referred to as “the end of the world” because it’s the world’s southernmost city, it features wild penguins, seals, and whales. Ushuaia is a base for travelers seeking hiking trails or exploring the coastline. It’s a hub among dense forest,  mountains, waterfalls, and glacier-fed lakes such as Roca and Fagnana.</p>

    <h2>Travel Tips</h2>
    <p>&emsp;&ensp;Patagonia is a very popular tourist destination, so you should plan your trip well in advance. Book your flights early to avoid high airline fees. If you’re flying from the US, most likely you’ll pass through Buenos Aires.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&ensp;Pack clothing you can layer to protect you from strong winds and temperatures that range from the 40s to 60s. Due to its large scale, the best way to get around Patagonia is by car or plane.</p>
