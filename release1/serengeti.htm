    <h1>Serengeti National Park</h1>

    <p>&emsp;&ensp;Serengeti National Park is a vast, treeless plain, populated with millions of animals in search of fresh grasslands. It’s particularly known for the annual wildebeest migration. In addition, some 500 birds have been identified on the Serengeti. It is the second largest national park in Tanzania, but probably the most famous, as well as the oldest. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it is one of the “Seven Natural Wonders of Africa” and one of the “Ten Natural Travel Wonders of the World,” due to the largest terrestrial mammal migration in the world (about 2 million animals). Although the best times for wildlife viewing are between December and June, the Serengeti is one of the few areas in Tanzania to offer good game viewing all year round. But we recommend avoiding the rainy season in April and May.</p>
	<p>&emsp;&ensp;Serengeti National Park fees are $60/person USD for visitors over the age of 16. $20/person USD for children, and free for children under the age of 5. There are four sections to the Serengeti: the Southern plains area, the Central Serengeti and Seronera area, the Western Serengeti area or Western Corridor, and the Northern Serengeti area.</p>
