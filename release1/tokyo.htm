    <h1>Tokyo</h1>

    <p>&emsp;&ensp;Tokyo is the largest metropolitan area in the world, with a population of over 36 million. The name was changed from Edo to Tokyo in 1890 during the Meiji Restoration.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&ensp;The national sport Sumo has deep roots in tradition and rituals that date back to its ancient origins as part of the Shinto religion. Sumo tournaments take place in Tokyo during January, May, and September. Tours of sumo stables are available year round in Tokyo and Osaka.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&ensp;One of the most famous sites in Tokyo is the Shibuya Crossing, the worldâ€™s busiest pedestrian intersection. Some 2,500 people cross the street every time the light changes.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&ensp;Cuisine in Japan is both an adventure and an art form. Although not actually a restaurant, the Robot Restaurant is a unique must-see &ndash; a bizarre, high-energy experience featuring robots, dragons, ninjas, blue-haired dancers, and strobing neon lights.</p>
