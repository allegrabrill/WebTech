    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Argentine Culture</h1>

    <p>&emsp;&ensp;Argentina has a very rich and diverse culture. Argentina derives from the latin word, argentum, meaning silver &ndash; making it the only country in the world to be named after a metal. Although original settlers believed that the country was full of silver, none has ever been found.</p>
	<p>&emsp;&ensp;Argentina is the birthplace of the tango dance, recognized in 2009 by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage contribution. Originating in the beginning of the 20th century, tango was born in the brothels of Buenos Aires, and has since become popular throughout the world as a romantic love dance. Initially, the tango was danced strictly by working class men and prostitutes. It wasn’t until Paris picked up the dance and made it a sensation throughout Europe that it became socially acceptable.</p>
	<p>&emsp;&ensp;In addition to tango, Argentina has a unique mix of cultures and ethnicities. It’s famous for football (soccer), steak, and wine. Yerba mate, a highly caffeinated drink, is a favorite alternative to alcohol. Asados, the national dish of Argentina, is barbecued meat (steak, ribs, sweetbreads, blood sausage, chorizo) &ndash; not very appealing to vegetarians, but worth a day of carnivorism. Perfectly paired with the meats, Argentina's exceptional wines were declared the country’s national liquor in 2010.</p>
