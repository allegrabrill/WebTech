    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Argentina - Know Before You Go</h1>

    <h2>General Information</h2>
	<p>&emsp;&ensp;As the eighth largest country in the world, and 2nd largest country in South America, Argentina is a must-see destination. The country shares borders with Chile to the west, Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, and Brazil and the Atlantic Ocean along the east coast. The 1,068,302 square miles that comprise Argentina are divided into four regions: the Andes, the North, the Pampas, and Patagonia. Each region’s geography is diverse, encompassing everything from harsh deserts to humid jungles, long ocean beaches and the soaring mountains of the Andes. From the subtropical north to the sub-antarctic regions of Patagonia in the south, Argentina’s diverse cultural, artistic, and architectural elements are rather outstanding.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&ensp;Argentina was once ranked among the world’s wealthiest nations for its production of livestock. Gauchos, the Argentinian version of American cowboys, have been a symbol of the open plains of the Pampas region.</p>
	<p>&emsp;&ensp;Buenos Aires, the country’s capital, is among South America’s most densely populated and sophisticated cities, nicknamed the “Paris of South America,” due to European influences and lively nightlife. Other major cities include Mar del Plata, La Plata, Bahia Blanca, and Rosario.</p>

    <h2>Brief History</h2>
    <p>&emsp;&ensp;The Spanish arrived in Argentina in 1516 and ruled for 300 years. In 1810, Napoleon’s forces conquered in Spain, and Argentine people, empowered, achieved independence in 1816. The late 20th century was a period of military dictatorship and repression during which thousands of presumed dissidents “disappeared.” In 1806, a British force overpowered Spanish military and attacked the Malvinas Islands, now known as the Falkland Islands. In 1982, Argentina invaded the South Atlantic islands but was defeated by British forces in a brutal battle. This led to the demise of the Argentine military regime and the reestablishment of democratic government. However, Argentina claims ownership of many South Atlantic islands, including the British-ruled Falkland Islands and a portion of Antarctica. The vast majority of Argentina’s population is of European descent, primarily Italian, Spanish, and German; unfortunately, most of the country’s indigenous population died during colonization.</p>

    <h2>Attractions</h2>
    <p>&emsp;&ensp;In addition to myriad cultural attractions, many people travel to Argentina due to the country’s natural wonders, including the stunning Iguazu Falls. Located along Argentina’s border with Brazil, Iguazu National Park is the world’s largest cluster of waterfalls, protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. There are various viewing platforms and accessible walkways enabling visitors to get very close, including some at the bottom of the falls, known as the Devil’s Throat.</p>

    <h2>Travel Tips</h2>
	<p>&emsp;&ensp;US citizens do not need a visa to go to Argentina. When visiting Argentina, carry Argentine cash and change &ndash; many places, even in Buenos Aires, do not accept credit cards, and if they do, they are likely to require a high minimum. Not only is Argentina expensive, but there’s a 10% minimum suggested tip at all restaurants and cafes. It’s a good idea to purchase a SUBE card for public transportation, which you can get at any kiosco &ndash; otherwise you’ll most likely pay double the cost for the same ride.</p>
