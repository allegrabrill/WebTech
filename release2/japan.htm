    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Japan - Know Before You Go</h1>

    <h2>General Information</h2>
	<p>&emsp;&ensp;Japan, an archipelago in the Pacific Ocean, consists of four main islands: Hokkaido, Honshu Shikoku, and Kyushu. There are also about 4,000 smaller islands. Japan’s nearest mainland neighbors are Russia to the north, and Korea and China to the south. About 80 percent of Japan is covered with mountains. The tectonic plates that meet near Japan, shape its geography and contribute to its 200 volcanoes, 60 of which are active and often trigger the more than a thousand earthquakes that hit Japan every year.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&ensp;The Japanese Alps in the center of Honshu feature Mount Fuji, the highest peak, considered sacred by many Japanese people. A major tourist destination, Mount Fuji is especially popular in the winter, when it’s snow-capped. Allow a few days to visit the towns Hakone and Kawaguchiko to increase your chances of seeing the peak, as Mount Fuji is often hidden by clouds. Japanese people have a deep affection for the beauty of the landscape. According to the ancient Shinto religion, natural features like mountains, waterfalls, and forests have their own spirits.</p>
    <p>Most of Japan is countryside, yet its population is more than 100 million.</p>

    <h2>Cuisine</h2>
    <p>&emsp;&ensp;Japanese cuisine centers around rice, fish, and vegetables, with very little meat. Low in fat and dairy, this diet is very healthy. Japanese people tend to live longer than any other population in the world.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&ensp;Although ramen originated in China, there’s no more classic Japanese food experience than a steaming bowl of these noodles. Not only is it delicious, it’s also quick and cheap.</p>

    <h2>Recent History</h2>
    <p>&emsp;&ensp;Following World War II, Japan’s economy was devastated. But Japanese culture places a heavy emphasis on work and clever innovation, which turned the economy around, making it a world leader. Japan’s high-tech industry introduced some of the world’s most popular electronics.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&ensp;Be sure to head to the heartbreaking Hiroshima’s Peace Memorial Park to pay your respects to the victims of the atomic bombing at Hiroshima. From there, proceed to the present-day city that was almost entirely rebuilt after World War II.</p>
