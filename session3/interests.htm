    <h1>My Interests</h1>
    <p class="intro">My top 3 interests are <a href="#anchor1">skiing</a>, <a href="#anchor2">traveling</a>, and <a href="#anchor3">music</a>. </p>
    <h2 id="anchor1">Skiing</h2>
    <p>I have been skiing with my Dad since I was 2 years old. It's always been a fun thing we've done together. I briefly skiied competitively, but was in a bad accident. Since then, I haven't raced again, but I've never missed a season.</p>

    <h2 id="anchor2">Traveling</h2>
    <p>I have been very fortunate to have had amazing travel opportunies and experiences. My family and I love to travel and explore different countries and cultures.<br>I have never viewed traveling as a &quot;vacation,&quot; because they usually aren't relaxing trips. My Dad makes sure we wake up early and make the most of our time in new places.</p>
    <h2 id="anchor3">Music</h2>
    <p>I love listening to music. My favorite genre is hip-hop, but I really love all types of music. After taking a music course at Babson, I learned how limiting genres are, and how much great music there is of all genres.</p><!--This paragraph is about music.-->
